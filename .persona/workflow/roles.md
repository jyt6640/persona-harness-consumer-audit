# Persona Workflow Role Boundaries

Status: active-boundary

Current implementation: role boundary artifact only.
No autonomous role-agent execution is implemented here.

## Role Map

| Role | Owns | Reads | Writes | Must Not Do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blackbear` | planning and requirement decomposition | README, prompt requirements, project profile, policies | `.persona/workflow/plan.md`, requirements draft/backlog | production code edits |
| `Charles` | execution coordination and state handoff | accepted plan, backlog, reports, evidence summaries | workflow status/next-step notes | direct feature implementation |
| `implementer` | implementation | accepted plan, current ticket, existing code | production code, tests, `.persona/workflow/implementation-report.md` | final review approval |
| `reviewer` | review and QA pressure | requirements, profile, plan, implementation report, generated code | `.persona/workflow/review-report.md` | feature implementation unless explicitly reassigned |

## Rail Mapping

- requirements rail -> `blackbear` first, then `Charles` for ticket state.
- programming rail -> `implementer` after plan/ticket readiness.
- debug rail -> `implementer` only after reproduction and hypotheses are recorded.
- review rail -> `reviewer`; code edits are out of scope unless the user asks for fixes.
- refactor rail -> `implementer` with `reviewer` review pressure after behavior is preserved.
- git rail -> `Charles` coordination before status/diff/commit/push/tag operations.

## Runtime Boundary

- This file is a workflow contract for a single AI agent.
- It does not spawn subagents.
- It does not certify generated app quality.
- It does not create build/test failure gates.
- Hook evidence may report mismatches, but remains report-only unless a later scope decision changes that.
